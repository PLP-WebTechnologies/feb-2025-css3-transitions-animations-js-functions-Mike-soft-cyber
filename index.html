        <h1>Into To CSS Animation</h1>
        <p>CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style to another.</p>
        <p>CSS animations are made up of two components: a style describing the animation and a set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation.</p>
        <p>CSS animations can be used to animate transitions between different states of an element, such as hover effects, loading animations, and more.</p>
        <p>CSS animations can be used to create complex animations by combining multiple keyframes and using different timing functions.</p>
